                    of the Programme Document or another Programme Document.  The IP will promptly comply with UNICEF’s
                    decision and in the latter case, the IP agrees that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII,
                    paragraph 12 above, it shall upon written instructions by UNICEF transfer ownership of the
                    supplies and equipment to the successor implementing partner designated by UNICEF.

                <li>The IP shall exercise the highest standard of care when using and administering such supplies and equipment,
                    and the IP shall place UNICEF markings thereon in consultation with UNICEF.
                </li>
                <li>Vehicles, if any, made available to the IP by UNICEF will be transferred on loan only.
                    Such vehicles will be provided to IP once the Parties sign the standard UNICEF vehicle loan agreement,
                    a copy of which will be provided to the IP.
