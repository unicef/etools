            <ol>
                <li>UNICEF will provide the IP with cash assistance for the activities as stipulated in the Programme
                    Documents (the “Cash Transfer”), subject to the availability of funds and the terms of this
                    Agreement. UNICEF’s assistance to the IP will not exceed the amounts included in the Programme
                    Documents. UNICEF will provide the cash assistance to the IP following three Cash Transfer
                    modalities (the “Cash Transfer Modalities” and each a “Cash Transfer Modality”):
                </li>
                <div>(a) Advance payment by UNICEF to IP (referred to in the HACT as “Direct Cash Transfer”);</div>
                <div>(b) Reimbursement by UNICEF to IP (referred to in the HACT as “Reimbursement”); and</div>
                <div>(c) Payment by UNICEF on IP’s behalf to IP’s vendor or supplier (referred to in HACT and in this
                    Agreement as “Direct Payment”).
                </div>
                <li>The Cash Transfer shall be done in installments as requested by the IP on the FACE form and
                    supporting itemized cost estimate representing the cash requirements to undertake the activities
                    identified in the Programme Documents or as otherwise decided by UNICEF (the “Cash Transfer
                    Installments” and each one of them separately a “Cash Transfer Installment”).
                </li>
                <li>In each Cash Transfer request, the IP will provide UNICEF with a written request for a Cash Transfer
                    Installment in an amount equal to the IP’s cash needs for the Quarter relating to the activities as
                    specified in the Programme Document. The first such written request is to be submitted when the IP
                    provides UNICEF with a signed copy of this Agreement and the Programme Document. The request will be
                    signed by an Authorized Officer.
                </li>
                <div><p><u>Cash Transfer procedures:</u></p></div>
                <li>Cash Transfer Installments will be transferred to or, where the Direct Payment modality is used, on
                    behalf of the IP solely to contribute to the implementation of the Programme Documents. The IP
                    agrees that the funds so transferred will be used exclusively for the implementation of the
                    Programme Documents.
                </li>
                <li>UNICEF will make each Cash Transfer Installment to or, where the Direct Payment modality is used, on
                    behalf of the IP in response to a written request from the IP, in accordance with the following
                    procedures:
                </li>
                <div><p><u>Procedures for requests for Cash Transfer Installments under all three Cash Transfer
                    Modalities:</u></p></div>
                <div>(a) Unless otherwise indicated by UNICEF in writing, every three calendar months during the term of
                    this Agreement (“Quarter”) the IP will provide UNICEF with a written request for the Cash Transfer
                    Installment in an amount equal to the IP’s cash needs for that Quarter relating to the activities as
                    specified in the Programme Document. The IP will do so using the FACE form and Itemized Cost
                    Estimate. The request will be signed by an Authorized Officer.
                </div>
                <div>(b) The first written request, using the FACE form, may be made as soon as this Agreement and the
                    Programme Document have been signed by both Parties. If such written request is in proper form and
                    complete, UNICEF will determine the amount to be transferred and will transfer that amount to or,
                    where the modality of Direct Payment is used, on behalf of the IP within a reasonable time.
                </div>
                <div>(c) Unless otherwise decided by UNICEF, the second and each subsequent written request, using the
                    FACE form, may not be made before expenditures have been reported to UNICEF, using the FACE form,
                    and activity progress has been reported using the PDPR. If such second or subsequent request is
                    received in a timely fashion and is in proper form and complete, UNICEF will determine the amount to
                    be transferred and will transfer that amount to or, where the modality of Direct Payment is used, on
                    behalf of the IP within a reasonable time.
                </div>
                <div><p><u>Additional procedures applicable only to Direct Payment modality:</u></p></div>
                <div>(d) The request for a Direct Payment is submitted using the FACE form and shall in all cases

                    time of Programme Document finalization.
                </div>
                <div>(e) For both Direct Payment and Reimbursement modalities, the requested expenditures should have
                    been previously authorized through the FACE form by UNICEF.
                </div>
                <div><p><u>Special terms and conditions for Cash Transfer Installments:</u></p></div>
                <li>Any request for a Cash Transfer Installment by the IP will fulfill the following criteria to the
                    satisfaction of UNICEF, failing which UNICEF may decide not to honor the request in whole or in
                    part:
                </li>
                <div>(a) The amount and purpose of the request will correspond to the provisions of the Programme
                    Document, including its activities, schedule and budget;
                </div>
                <div>(b) The request will be reasonable and justified under principles of sound financial management, in
                    particular the principles of value for money and cost-effectiveness;
                </div>
                <div>(c) There are to be no other grounds for believing the expenditure is in contravention of this
                    Agreement, including the Programme Document; and
                </div>
                <div>(d) Subject to paragraph 4(d) above, prior Cash Transfer Installments will have been reported on to
                    UNICEF’s satisfaction in accordance with Article X of this Agreement.
                </div>
                <li>UNICEF may decide to adjust the amount of any Cash Transfer Installment where it has reason to do
                    so, including:
                </li>
                <div>(a) To take into consideration the general progress made to date under the Programme Document; or
                </div>
                <div>(b) To offset any unspent or unreported balance remaining with the IP from any previous Cash
                    Transfer Installment
                </div>
                <li>UNICEF will only be required to transfer to or, where the Direct Payment modality is used, on behalf
                    of, the IP the amount UNICEF determines is due under the terms of this Agreement. The IP agrees that
                    UNICEF will not be liable to the IP or any third party, including the IP’s vendor or supplier, for
                    any amounts that UNICEF determines are not in compliance with this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>(a) The administration by the IP of the Cash Transfer shall be carried out under its own financial
                    regulations, rules and procedures, which UNICEF has reviewed and assessed and found to be
                    appropriate.
                </li>
                <div>(b) Where, in accordance with HACT, UNICEF provides a Cash Transfer prior to the review and
                    assessment of the IP’s financial regulations, rules and procedures, then in the event UNICEF
                    subsequently determines that the IP’s financial regulations, rules and procedures are not
                    appropriate, UNICEF shall give written notice to the IP and in such case UNICEF may require return
                    of unspent Cash Transfers already provided to the IP and may decide to implement the Programme
                    Document or any parts thereof (including any procurement activities) directly.
                </div>
                <li>Where the IP buys goods or services from the Cash Transfer, the IP shall do so giving due
                    consideration to the following principles:

                </li>
                <li>The IP will become owner of the supplies and equipment when it receives them. In the event that

                    will become owner of those supplies and equipment as agreed between UNICEF and the IP.
                    Exceptionally, UNICEF may decide in writing that UNICEF shall remain the owner of the supplies and
                    equipment transferred to the IP by UNICEF.

                    to another implementing partner in connection with implementation of the Programme Document or
                    another Programme Document. The IP will promptly comply with UNICEF’s decision and in the latter
                    case, the IP agrees that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 12 above, it
                    shall upon written instructions by UNICEF transfer ownership of the supplies and equipment to the
                    successor implementing partner designated by UNICEF.
