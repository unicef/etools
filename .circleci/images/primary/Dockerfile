# We need a newer virtualenv than what Debian jessie would give us
# if we used the distribution package. Installing using pip will
# get the latest, which will in turn include recent pip itself,
# and setuptools.  Using pip2 means that when the older code
# invokes 'virtualenv' it'll end up with a Python 2 virtualenv
# by default, which is what it needs.
RUN pip install virtualenv
