<span class="c5 c0">EQUITRACK & eTOOLS</span>

<span class="c0">The predecessor to eTools was a system developed in the Lebanon Country Office (LCO) called Equitrack. The success of Equitrack’s use in LCO drew other country programmes in MENA to also begin using it. With over 20 locally developed systems being used in country offices, FRG and EMOPS convened various stakeholders from the organization to design a universal platform for managing results for children. Equitrack was determined to be the system closest to addressing the common needs of this group. eTools manifested from the foundational elements of Equitrack, and has ever since been introduced with new features.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Today, the eTools team has made three notable restructuring in the way it functions moving forward: Core Project Team has 3 defined work streams for managing the platform from scoping to development to support. External software firms will begin to take on software development activities while the eTools Engineering is concentrating on technical project management and developer operations.</span>
