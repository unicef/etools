      <p>8.4 With respect to each Programme Document:</p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) Cash Transfer Installments will be transferred to (or, where the
          Direct Payment modality is used, on behalf of the Partner) solely to
          contribute to the implementation of such Programme Document; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The Partner agrees that the funds so transferred will be used

      <p>
        8.5 UNICEF will make each Cash Transfer Installment to (or, where the
        Direct Payment modality is used, on behalf of the Partner) in response to
        a written request from the Partner, in accordance with the following
        procedures:

      <p class="underline">
        Procedures for requests for Cash Transfer Installments under all three
        Cash Transfer Modalities:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) Unless otherwise indicated by UNICEF in writing, every three
          calendar months during the term of this Agreement (each, a "Quarter"),
          the Partner will provide UNICEF with a written request for the Cash
          Transfer Installment in an amount equal to the Partner`s cash needs for
          that Quarter relating to the activities as specified in the Programme
          Document. The Partner will do so using the FACE form and Itemized Cost
          Estimate. The request must be signed by an Authorized Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The first written request, using the FACE form, may be made as soon
          as this Agreement and the relevant Programme Document have been signed
          by both Parties. If such written request is in proper form and complete,
          UNICEF will determine the amount to be transferred and will transfer
          that amount to (or, where the modality of Direct Payment is used, on
          behalf of the Partner) within a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Unless otherwise decided by UNICEF, the second and each subsequent
          written request, using the FACE form, requires that reporting on the use
          of the first Cash Transfer Installment has been received by UNICEF
          before a Cash Transfer Installment for a subsequent three month period
          will be released. If such second or subsequent request is received in a
          timely fashion and is in proper form and complete, UNICEF will determine
          the amount to be transferred and will transfer that amount to (or, where
          the modality of Direct Payment is used, on behalf of the Partner) within
          a reasonable time.
        </p>
        <p class="underline">
          Additional procedures applicable only to Direct Payment modality:
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) The request for a Direct Payment must be submitted using the FACE
          form and must in all cases include the vendor`s complete details and
          banking information in a format specified by UNICEF.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) For both Direct Payment and Reimbursement modalities, the requested
          expenditures must previously be authorized through the FACE form by
          UNICEF.
        </p>
      </div>

        Special terms and conditions for Cash Transfer Installments:
      </p>
      <p>
        8.6 Any request for a Cash Transfer Installment by the Partner must
        fulfill the following criteria to the satisfaction of UNICEF, failing
        which UNICEF may decide not to honor the request in whole or in part:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) The amount and purpose of the request must correspond to the
          provisions of the Programme Document, including its activities, schedule
          and budget;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The request must be reasonable and justified under principles of
          sound financial management, in particular the principles of value for
          money and cost-effectiveness;
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) There are to be no other grounds for believing the expenditure is in
          contravention of this Agreement, including the Programme Document; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Subject to paragraph 5(c) above, prior Cash Transfer Installments
          must have been reported on to UNICEF`s satisfaction in accordance with
          Article X of this Agreement.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        8.7 UNICEF may decide to adjust the amount of any Cash Transfer
        Installment where it has reason to do so, including:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) To take into consideration the general progress made to date under
          the Programme Document;
        </p>
        <p>(b) To offset for any Ineligible Expenditures; or</p>
        <p>
          (c) To offset any unspent or unreported balance remaining with the
          Partner from any previous Cash Transfer Installments.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        8.8 UNICEF will only be required to transfer to or, where the Direct
        Payment modality is used, on behalf of, the Partner the amount UNICEF
        determines is due under the terms of this Agreement. The IP agrees that
        UNICEF will not be liable to the Partner or any third party, including the
        Partner`s vendors or suppliers, for any amounts that UNICEF determines are
        not in compliance with this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.9 (a) The administration by the Partner of the Cash Transfer must be
        carried out under its own financial regulations, rules and procedures,
        which UNICEF has reviewed and assessed and found to be appropriate.
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (b) Where, in accordance with HACT, UNICEF provides a Cash Transfer
          prior to the review and assessment of the Partner`s financial
          regulations, rules and procedures, then in the event UNICEF subsequently
          determines that the Partner`s financial regulations, rules and
          procedures are not appropriate, UNICEF will give written notice to the
          Partner and in such case UNICEF may require return of unspent Cash
          Transfers already provided to the Partner and may decide to implement
          the Programme Document or any parts thereof (including any procurement
          activities) directly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        8.10 Where the Partner buys goods or services from the Cash Transfer, the
        Partner must do so giving due consideration to the following principles:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>(a) Best value for money;</p>
        <p>(b) Fairness, integrity and transparency;</p>
        <p>(c) Competition.</p>

        8.12 Supplies and equipment transferred to the Partner by UNICEF will be
        used exclusively for the implementation of the Programme Document, unless
        UNICEF agrees otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.13 The Partner will become owner of the supplies and equipment when it
        receives them. In the event that UNICEF agrees to store the supplies and
        equipment for the Partner or hold them on the Partner`s behalf, the
        Partner will become owner of those supplies and equipment as agreed
        between UNICEF and the Partner. Exceptionally, UNICEF may decide in
        writing that UNICEF will remain the owner of the supplies and equipment
        transferred to the Partner by UNICEF.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.14 UNICEF may decide that supplies and equipment already transferred to
        the Partner should be deployed by the Partner for implementation of
        another Programme Document, or reassigned. The Partner will promptly
        comply with UNICEF`s decision and in the latter case, the Partner agrees
        that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, paragraph 12 above,
        it must upon written instructions by UNICEF transfer ownership of the
        supplies and equipment according to UNICEF`s instructions.

        8.15 The Partner will exercise the highest standard of care when using and
        administering such supplies and equipment, and the Partner will place
        UNICEF markings thereon in consultation with UNICEF.
      </p>

        8.16 Vehicles, if any, made available to the Partner by UNICEF will be

        made by the Partner under this Agreement, including the amount of any
        unspent funds. Without limiting the foregoing, the Partner is required to
        maintain:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) Records showing which transactions recorded in its accounting system
          represent the expenditures reported for each line on the FACE forms and
          any income earned by the Partner in relation to Advance Payments (Direct
          Cash Transfers) made by UNICEF;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Original documentation including bills, invoices, receipts and any
          other relevant documentation, which must be kept by the Partner for a
          period of five (5) years after the completion of the last Programme
          Document or the termination of this Agreement, whichever happens later.
          Such documentation will include but not be limited to purchase orders,
          suppliers` invoices, contracts, delivery notes, leases, payment
          vouchers, bank statements, airline tickets, gasoline coupons, payroll
          records, employment contracts, attendance lists, expenses claims, petty
          cash receipts, journal vouchers, procurement files documenting
          competitive and fair selection, and any other relevant supporting
          documentation. Unless agreed in advance with UNICEF, the Partner will
          ensure that all vouchers related to the utilization of Cash Transfers
          carry clear notation showing a reference to the Programme Document. The
          Partner understands that a written statement by the Partner that money
          has been spent is insufficient and cannot replace the original
          documentation to support expenditures.

        the Partner and kept for a period of five (5) years after the completion

      </p>
      <p>11.1 For each Programme Document:</p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) Upon completion of the Partner`s activities under such Programme
          Document, the Partner will refund to UNICEF the unspent balances of all
          Cash Transfers under that Programme Document (which will be reported on
          the final FACE form submitted by the Partner) and all other amounts of
          money it is not entitled to.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Upon completion of the Partner`s activities under such Programme
          Document, the Partner will return to UNICEF all unused supplies and

        of the Partner) with regard to that Programme Document. UNICEF may decide
        that such non-expendable equipment will be transferred for other use. In
        that case, the Partner will, upon written instructions by UNICEF, transfer
        ownership of such property accordingly.
      </p>
      <p class="strong">12. Privileges and Immunities; Resolution of Disputes</p>
      <p>
        12.1 In accordance with Article 18 of the General Terms and Conditions for
        Programme Cooperation Agreements, nothing in or relating to this Agreement
        will be deemed a waiver, express or implied, of any of the privileges and
        immunities of the United Nations, including UNICEF.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.2 The Parties will use their best efforts to amicably settle any
        dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of this Agreement or the
        breach, termination, or invalidity thereof. Where the Parties wish to seek
        such an amicable settlement through conciliation, the conciliation will
        take place in accordance with the Conciliation Rules of the United Nations
        Commission on International Trade Law ("UNCITRAL") then in force, or
        according to such other procedure as may be agreed between the Parties in
        writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.3 Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising out of
        this Agreement which is not solved within ninety (90) days after one Party
        receives a request from the other Party for amicable settlement, can be
        referred by either Party to arbitration. The arbitration will take place
        in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then in force. The venue
        of the arbitration will be New York, NY, USA. The decisions of the
        arbitral tribunal will be based on general principles of international
        commercial law. The arbitral tribunal will have no authority to award
        punitive damages. In addition, unless otherwise expressly provided in the
        Agreement, the arbitral tribunal will have no authority to award interest
        in excess of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") then prevailing,
        and any such interest will be simple interest only. Should LIBOR no longer
        be available, the United States Federal Reserve Bank of New York`s Secured
        Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) then prevailing shall be used, and any
        such interest shall be simple interest only. In light of the privileges
        and immunities of UNICEF, references in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to
        the place of arbitration shall connote only the actual location for the
        arbitral proceedings but shall not mean the "seat" or "juridical seat" or
        "juridical place" for such proceedings. The Parties will be bound by any
        arbitration award rendered as a result of such arbitration as the final
        adjudication of any such dispute, controversy, or claim.
      </p>
      <p class="strong">13. Final Provisions</p>
      <p>
        13.1 This Agreement will enter into force on the date it is signed by both
        Parties. It will expire on the last day of the Programme, unless
        terminated earlier in accordance with Article 13 of the General Terms and
        Conditions for Programme Cooperation Agreements.

      <p class="text-center strong">FOR PROGRAMME COOPERATION AGREEMENTS</p>
      <p>
        1. <span class="strong">LEGAL STATUS:</span> The Partner will be
        considered as having the legal status of an independent contractor
        vis-&agrave;-vis UNICEF. The Partner`s employees, personnel and
        sub-contractors will not be considered in any respect as being the
        employees or agents of UNICEF.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <span class="strong">ASSIGNMENT:</span> The Partner will not assign,
        transfer, pledge or make other disposition of this Agreement or any parts
        thereof or any of the Partner`s rights, claims or obligations under this
        Agreement except with the prior written consent of UNICEF.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. <span class="strong">SUBCONTRACTING:</span> The Partner may not use the
        services of subcontractors unless permission is granted in advance by
        UNICEF in writing in any particular case. If UNICEF approves a particular
        subcontracting of services, the Partner will ensure that its
        subcontractors do not use further tiers of subcontractors, including
        sub-subcontractors, unless UNICEF has given prior written permission in
        each particular case. The use by the Partner of any subcontractors, or of
        further tiers of subcontractors, will not relieve the Partner of any of
        its obligations under this Agreement. The terms of any subcontract,
        sub-subcontract and so forth will be subject to, conform to and give full
        effect to the provisions of this Agreement. In particular, the Partner
        will ensure that any subcontract or further tiers of subcontracts include
        provisions substantially the same as Article 4.
      </p>
      <p>4. <span class="strong">ETHICAL STANDARDS</span></p>
      <p>
        4.1 <span class="strong">Partner Declaration:</span> UNICEF requires a
        duly authorized officer of the Partner to complete and sign a Partner
        Declaration prior to signing this Agreement. The Partner Declaration is an
        integral part of this Agreement and is incorporated into this Agreement by
        reference. The Partner understands that the representations and
        declarations in the Partner Declaration are essential for UNICEF entering
        into this Agreement. UNICEF has the right to terminate this Agreement with
        immediate effect if it becomes aware of any misrepresentations or
        omissions by the Partner in the Declaration. The Partner will inform
        UNICEF as soon as it becomes aware of any incident or report that is
        inconsistent with the representations and declarations provided in the
        Partner Declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2
        <span class="strong"
          >Partner`s Responsibility for Employees, Personnel and
          Subcontractors:</span
        >
        The Partner will be responsible for the professional and technical
        competence of its employees, personnel and subcontractors and will select,
        for work under this Agreement, reliable persons and entities who will
        perform effectively in the implementation of this Agreement, respect the
        local laws and customs, and conform to a high standard of moral and
        ethical conduct, which includes safeguarding. Before selection, employees
        and other personnel and subcontractors` personnel will be asked if they
        have been dismissed from a previous employer for misconduct, or left while
        being investigated for misconduct and were never cleared. Appropriate
        reference or background checks will also be conducted. The Partner will
        disclose whether it has any dismissed any individuals for safeguarding
        violations or sexual exploitation and abuse in the last 5 years, and
        whether any are still working at the Partner and proposed to work under
        the Agreement. At any time during the term of the Agreement, UNICEF can
        make a written request that the Partner replace one or more of the
        assigned employees or other personnel or subcontractors` personnel. UNICEF
        will not be required to give an explanation or justification for this
        request. Within seven (7) working days of receiving UNICEF`s request, the
        Partner must replace the individual in question with an individual
        acceptable to UNICEF.

          separating from UNICEF, involved in any aspect of the process leading to
          the Partner`s selection or the implementation of the Programme; and (ii)
          during the two year period after an official has separated from UNICEF,
          the former official may not, directly or indirectly on behalf of the

          Partner on any matters that were within such former official's
          responsibilities while at UNICEF.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Partner further represents and warrants that, in respect of all
          aspects of the Agreement (including the entering into the Agreement by

          it has disclosed to UNICEF any situation that may constitute an actual
          or potential conflict of interest or could reasonably be perceived as a
          conflict of interest.

              purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily,
              socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another;
            </p>
            <p>
              (ii) "sexual abuse" means the actual or threatened physical
              intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or
              coercive conditions. Sexual exploitation and abuse are strictly
              prohibited;
            </p>
            <p>
              (iii) "child" means any person less than eighteen (18) years of age,
              regardless of any laws relating to consent or when one legally
              becomes an adult.
            </p>
            <p>
              (iv) "safeguarding" is the reduction of risks of harm arising from a
              party`s work, employees or other personnel, or subcontractors.
            </p>
            <p>
              (v) "safeguarding violation" is a conduct by a party`s employees,
              personnel or subcontractors that actually or likely causes
              significant harm to a person, including any kind of physical,
              emotional or sexual abuse, neglect or exploitation.

          In addition, in this Agreement:
          <div class="indent">
            <p>
              (i) Any sexual acts involving a person who cannot consent or is not
              consenting at the time, will be sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              (ii) Sexual activity with a child will always be sexual abuse, even
              if there is a mistake about the age of the child, or the person is
              married to the child.
            </p>
            <p>
              (iii) Demanding, giving, offering or receiving anything (money,
              employment, goods, services, or other things of value) for sexual
              touching or sexual activities with anyone will be sexual
              exploitation. This includes paying or offering money for sex with a
              prostitute.
            </p>
            <p>
              (iv) Anyone who might affect who gets goods or services must not
              have sex with anyone who may get that help. It will be sexual
              exploitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              (v) Exploitative labor is a safeguarding violation. This means
              workers must be allowed to freely associate and collectively
              bargain. Workers must not be forced or compelled to work. Workers
              must not be subject to discrimination. Workers must be given a safe
              and healthy working environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              (vi) Child labor is a safeguarding violation. This means no child
              under 14 will work under the Agreement. Further, any child working
              must be above the age the law requires for mandatory school and the
              minimum age for work.

        <li>
          Policies. The Partner has read (a) ST/SGB/2003/13 entitled "Special
          Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse",
          which is available at
          <a href="https://undocs.org/ST/SGB/2003/13"
            >https://undocs.org/ST/SGB/2003/13</a
          >; and (b) UNICEF`s policies related to safeguarding, available at
          <a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/documents/safeguarding-policy"
            >https://www.unicef.org/supply/documents/safeguarding-policy</a
          >
          (or another URL given to the Partner). The Partner will either adopt its
          own policy/policies that are at least as stringent as these policies, or
          apply these policies. The Partner will require subcontractors to do the
          same. The Partner will also have a policy that makes it a misconduct to
          retaliate against anyone for reporting or cooperating in an
          investigation of safeguarding violations, including sexual exploitation
          and abuse. The Partner shall require its employees and other personnel
          and persons working for subcontractors to agree to a code of conduct
          that covers behavior in these policies.
        </li>

        <li>
          Prevention. The Partner will take all appropriate measures to have its
          employees and other personnel and subcontractors demonstrate behaviour
          that proactively safeguards, including protecting from sexual
          exploitation and abuse. The Partner must ensure employees and other
          personnel and subcontractors have an understanding of their obligations
          and: (i) what is safeguarding in programming, the importance of risk
          assessments of planned activities, events, and interventions to plan
          mitigation measures, and reflect those in relevant Programme Documents;
          (ii) of the kinds of safeguarding concerns, and definitions of
          safeguarding violations and sexual exploitation and sexual abuse; (iii)
          why any unsafe or prohibited behavior as outlined in UNICEF Safeguarding
          Policy, including any form of sexual exploitation and abuse, is
          unacceptable, as it harms people and destroys trust in the work; (iv)
          the need to properly supervise children and workers; (v) the
          requirements in this Agreement to promptly report to UNICEF safeguarding
          violations, sexual exploitation and sexual abuse; (vi) how other
          safeguarding concerns should be raised by employees or other personnel
          or subcontractors at the Partner, and addressed in consultation with
          UNICEF; and (vii) the requirements in this Agreement to facilitate
          victim assistance. To gain this understanding, the Partner will, among
          other things, ensure that its employees, personnel or subcontractors
          successfully complete and renew appropriate training.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reporting of allegations to UNICEF. The Partner will promptly and
          confidentially, in a manner that assures the safety of all involved,
          report allegations of safeguarding violations, including but not limited
          to sexual exploitation and abuse, arising from this Agreement, of which
          the Partner has been informed or has otherwise become aware, to (i) the
          UNICEF head of office, or (ii) the UNICEF Director Office of Internal
          Audit and Investigation (<a href="mailto:integrity1@unicef.org"
            >integrity1@unicef.org</a
          >), or (iii) other reporting channels established locally by UNICEF
          Country Offices and communicated to the Partner. This obligation
          survives the expiry or termination of the Agreement, with respect to
          incidents occurring during the term of this Agreement.
        </li>

        <li>
          Assistance. Alleged victims of safeguarding concerns, including sexual
          exploitation and abuse, will be promptly informed of and referred to
          available professional assistance, according to their consent and in
          coordination with UNICEF. This obligation survives the expiry or
          termination of the Agreement, with respect to incidents occurring during
          the term of this Agreement.
        </li>

        <li>
          Investigation. The Partner will properly and without delay investigate
          allegations of safeguarding violations, including sexual exploitation
          and abuse, by the Partner`s employees, personnel, or subcontractors. The
          Partner will keep UNICEF informed during the conduct of the
          investigation, without prejudice to the due process rights of any
          persons concerned. UNICEF may require the Partner to suspend any
          individual from work under this Agreement while under investigation.
          Following the conclusion of the investigation by the Partner, the
          Partner will promptly provide reports on the outcome of the
          investigation, including any relevant details relating to the alleged
          offender, to the extent legally possible. Upon request, the Partner will
          provide relevant evidence to UNICEF for examination and further use by
          UNICEF as deemed necessary solely by UNICEF. UNICEF may decide that the
          obligation on the part of the Partner under the first sentence of this
          Article 4.5(g) to conduct an investigation will not apply if an
          investigation is being or has been conducted by competent national
          authorities. In the event that competent national authorities are
          conducting or have conducted the investigation, the Partner will assist
          UNICEF and take all necessary steps, to the extent legally possible, for
          UNICEF to obtain information on the status and outcome of the
          investigation. These obligations will survive the expiry or termination
          of this Agreement, with respect to incidents occurring during the term
          of this Agreement. The Partner will provide information to UNICEF about
          any action it has taken in response to the incident to meet safeguarding
          standards and reduce the chance of similar concerns in the future. It is
          understood that UNICEF expects that safeguarding concerns and violations
          will always be addressed. It is further understood that any
          investigation conducted by the Partner under this clause will be without
          prejudice to the right of UNICEF under Article 15.3 to conduct
          investigations.

        <span class="strong">Ethical Standards in Evidence Generation:</span> For
        any research, evaluations and data collection and analysis involving human
        subjects or analyzing sensitive secondary data, the Partner must comply
        with the current version of the
        <a

        >
        If the programme activities under a Programme Document involve the
        generation of imagery, media/press contacts, online platforms or other
        safeguarding concerns, UNICEF may require the Partner to comply with
        further procedures or standards addressing those risks as set out in the
        Programme Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.
        <span class="strong">RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS AND INDEMNIFICATION:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        5.1 UNICEF will not accept any liability for claims arising out of the
        activities performed by the Partner under this Agreement, or any claims
        for death, bodily injury, disability, and damage to property or other
        hazards that may be suffered by the Partner`s employees and personnel as a
        result of their work pertaining to the Programme. The Partner will be
        responsible for administering all claims brought against it by its
        employees and personnel. The Partner will also be fully responsible for
        adequate medical and life insurance for its employees and personnel, as
        well as insurance coverage for service-incurred illness, disability or
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 The Partner will indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend, at its
        own expense, UNICEF, its officials, employees, consultants and agents,
        from and against all suits, claims, demands, losses and liability of any
        nature or kind, including their costs and expenses, by any third party and
        arising out of the acts or omissions of the Partner, or its employees,
        officers, agents or subcontractors, in the performance of this Agreement.
        This provision will extend to but not be limited to (a) claims and
        liability in the nature of workmen's compensation, (b) product liability,
        and (c) any liability arising out of the use of patented inventions or
        devices, copyrighted material or other intellectual property provided or
        licensed to UNICEF under this Agreement or used by the Partner, its
        employees, officers, agents, or subcontractors in the implementation of
        this Agreement. The obligations under this Article do not lapse upon
        termination of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. <span class="strong">ENCUMBRANCES/LIENS:</span> The Partner will not
        cause or permit any lien, attachment or other encumbrance by any person to
        be placed on file or to remain on file in any public office against any
        monies due or to become due for any work done, services rendered or
        materials, supplies or equipment furnished under this Agreement, or by
        reason of any other claim or demand against the Partner.
      </p>
      <p>7. <span class="strong">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:</span></p>
      <p>
        7.1 With respect to each Programme under this Agreement, the following
        provisions will apply, unless a specific amendment is made in writing for
        that Programme in accordance with Section 20 that expressly references
        this Section 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.2 Subject to paragraph 7.3 below, UNICEF will be entitled to all
        intellectual property and other proprietary rights with regard to
        analyses, reports, processes, software, data, tools, documents and other
        materials, including any deliverables (collectively, the "Programme
        Materials"), which the Partner develops, produces, prepares or collects
        during the implementation of the Programme. The Partner will take all
        necessary steps, execute all necessary documents and generally assist in
        securing such intellectual property and other proprietary rights and
        transferring or licensing them to UNICEF in compliance with the
        requirements of applicable law and of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.3 Neither Party will be entitled to any intellectual property or other
        proprietary rights of the other Party that pre-existed the implementation
        of the Programme, or were or are developed or acquired independently of
        the implementation of the Programme ("Background IP"). To the extent that
        the Partner`s Background IP is incorporated into the Programme Materials,
        the Partner grants to UNICEF the non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide,
        perpetual, transferable and sub-licensable license to use, reproduce and
        adapt such pre-existing intellectual property for non-commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.4 The Parties may use intellectual property licensed from third parties
        ("Third Party IP") to assist in the development of the Programme
        Materials. If such Third Party IP is incorporated into or otherwise
        essential for the use of the Programme Materials, this will be reflected
        in the Programme Document, including any conditions or restrictions on use
        of such Third Party IP. The Parties will comply with such conditions and
        restrictions, including the relevant license terms on which the Third
        Party IP is made available to the Parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.5 Subject to the foregoing paragraphs 7.1-7.4, the Programme Materials
        will be made available for use or inspection by UNICEF at reasonable times
        and in reasonable places, will be treated as confidential, and will be
        delivered only to UNICEF authorized officials upon completion of the
        activities under a Programme.
      </p>
      <p>8. <span class="strong">CONFIDENTIALITY:</span></p>
      <p>
        8.1 The Partner will respect the confidentiality of all information that
        UNICEF advises the Partner is confidential, and will treat it no less
        confidentially than the Partner`s most confidential information. The
        Partner will use safeguards and controls (such as administrative,
        technical, physical, procedural and security infrastructures, facilities,
        tools, technologies, practices and other protective measures) that are
        necessary and sufficient to meet the Partner`s confidentiality obligations
        in this Article 8 as they apply to UNICEF`s confidential information.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.2 When the Partner is required to disclose UNICEF`s confidential
        information by law, the Partner will give UNICEF sufficient prior notice
        of a request for the disclosure of information in order to allow UNICEF to
        have reasonable opportunities to take protective measures or such other
        actions as may be appropriate prior to any disclosure being made.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.3 The obligations of non-disclosure set forth above will not apply to
        information received by the Partner to the extent that such information:
        (a) was previously known to the Partner; (b) thereafter becomes, through
        no fault of the Partner, generally available to the public; (c) was
        received by the Partner from a third party not under an obligation of
        confidentiality to UNICEF; or (d) was developed by the Partner independent
        of any non-disclosure obligations under this Agreement.

        8.4 The obligations under this Article do not lapse upon termination of
        this Agreement.

      <p>9. <span class="strong">DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY:</span></p>
      <p>
        9.1 The Partner confirms that it has a data protection policy in place
        that meets all applicable data protection standards and legal requirements
        and that it will apply such policy in the collection, use, storage,
        processing, retention and destruction of data received by or collected by
        the Partner in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
        With respect to each Programme, the Partner agrees to comply with any
        additional data protection and security measures for the processing of
        data notified by UNICEF for such Programme. The Partner will only use such
        data in order to implement the respective Programme Document. The Partner
        will promptly notify UNICEF of any actual or suspected or threatened
        incident of accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss,
        alteration, unauthorized or accidental disclosure or access to such data
        and will use all reasonable measures to mitigate such destruction, loss,
        alteration, disclosure or access.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.2 With respect to each Programme, where collection, access, use and
        processing of Personal Data is part of the responsibilities of the Partner
        under a Programme Document, the Partner must sign UNICEF`s Data Processing
        Agreement as a supplemental agreement to such Programme Document prior to
        the start of any collection, access, use and processing of such Personal
        Data. "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or
        identifiable individual.

        Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the Parties is
        permitted to use the other`s name, logo, and emblem, as applicable, solely
        in connection with this Agreement and the implementation of the Programme
        Documents, unless permission is withdrawn in any particular case by any of
        the Parties and notified in writing to the other Party. When reporting to
        third parties and/or the general public, the Partner will provide
        visibility and fully identify and acknowledge the support of UNICEF, in
        alignment with the current UNICEF Brand guidelines. At UNICEF`s request,
        the Partner will also provide visibility, as specified by UNICEF, to
        UNICEF`s donors that are contributing funds for the Agreement. Where such
        visibility would jeopardize the safety and security of the Partner`s
        staff, the Partner will communicate this information to UNICEF and propose
        appropriate alternative arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. <span class="strong"> COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY.</span> UNICEF and
        the Partner acknowledge their shared commitment to transparency. In this
        regard, each Party may include references to this Agreement and to their
        respective contributions to the implementation of this Agreement in their
        public reports and in other materials in accordance with their respective
        regulations, rules, policies and practices. UNICEF may disclose
        information about the Partner pursuant to its policies, regulations, rules
        and procedures and resolutions or regulations of UNICEF`s governing
        bodies; this includes public disclosure by UNICEF of the Partner`s name,
        the cash transfer amount from UNICEF to the Partner, location, purpose and
        title of the Programme interventions. UNICEF may disclose to other UN
        entities (i) the identities of individuals the Partner has dismissed or
        removed for safeguarding violations, including sexual exploitation and
        abuse; and (ii) the name of the Partner if this Agreement is suspended or
        terminated, for failure to adequately safeguard or protect against sexual
        exploitation and abuse. UNICEF may also disclose publicly non-personal
        data about allegations of safeguarding violations, including sexual
        exploitation and abuse.

      <p>
        12.1 In the event of and as soon as possible after the occurrence of any
        cause constituting force majeure (as defined below), the Partner will give
        notice and full particulars in writing to UNICEF, of such occurrence or
        change if the Partner is thereby rendered unable, wholly or in part, to
        perform its obligations and meet its responsibilities under this
        Agreement. The Partner will also notify UNICEF of any other changes in
        conditions or the occurrence of any event that interferes or threatens to
        interfere with its performance of this Agreement. On receipt of the notice
        required under this Article, UNICEF will take such action as it considers,
        in its sole discretion, to be appropriate or necessary in the

        12.2 If the Partner is rendered permanently unable, wholly or in part, by
        reason of force majeure to perform its obligations and meet its
        responsibilities under this Agreement, UNICEF will have the right to
        suspend or terminate this Agreement on the same terms and conditions as
        are provided for in Article 13, except that the period of notice will be
        seven (7) days instead of thirty (30) days.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.3 Force majeure as used in this Article means any unforeseeable and
        irresistible act of nature, any act of war (whether declared or not),
        invasion, revolution, insurrection, terrorism, or any other acts of a
        similar force or nature, provided that such acts arise from causes beyond
        the control and without the fault or negligence of the Party concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.4 The Partner acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any
        obligations under this Agreement that the Partner must perform in or for
        any areas in which UNICEF is engaged in, preparing to engage in, or
        disengaging from any peacekeeping, humanitarian or similar operations, any
        delays or failure to perform such obligations arising from or relating to
        harsh conditions within such areas or to any incidents of civil unrest
        occurring in such areas will not, in and of itself, constitute force
        majeure.

      <p>13. <span class="strong">SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION:</span></p>
      <p>

          (14) calendar days` written notice to do so with effect from a date
          specified in such notice; and
        </p>

        Agreement and any other agreements between UNICEF and the Partner with
        immediate effect upon written notice to the Partner in each of the
        following situations:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          (a) implementation of any Programme Document has not commenced within a
          reasonable time;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) if UNICEF becomes aware of any incident or report that is
          inconsistent with, or the Partner breaches any of the provisions
          provided in Article 4 or the equivalent provisions of any other
          agreement between UNICEF and the Partner; or (ii) the Partner or any of
          its affiliates, or personnel or directors becomes subject to any
          sanction or temporary suspension described in Article 4.4(b) during the
          term of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) the Partner breaches any of the provisions of Article 8
          (Confidentiality) and Article 9 (Data Protection and Security);

          the ability of the Partner to perform any of its obligations under this
          Agreement. The Partner will immediately inform UNICEF of the occurrence
          of any of the events described in this paragraph (e).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        13.3 The Party receiving a notice of suspension or termination will
        immediately take all necessary steps to suspend or terminate (as the case
        may be) its activities in an orderly manner so that continued expenses are
        kept to a minimum. In the case of suspension, if the Partner takes
        appropriate action to address the relevant incident or breach to UNICEF`s
        satisfaction within the period stipulated in the notice of suspension,
        UNICEF may lift the suspension by written notice to the Partner and the
        Agreement and all other affected agreements will resume in accordance with
        their terms. If, however, UNICEF is not satisfied that the matters are
        being adequately addressed by the Partner, UNICEF may at any time,
        exercise its right to terminate the Agreement and any other agreement
        between UNICEF and the Partner. Any suspension or termination under this
        Article 13 will be without any liability for termination or other charges
        or any other liability of any kind.

        13.5 On termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 13, the
        Partner will (a) transfer either to UNICEF or in accordance with UNICEF`s
        instructions the unexpended balance of the Cash Transfer held by the
        Partner and the unused supplies and equipment provided by UNICEF under

        this Agreement or purchased by the Partner using funds provided by UNICEF
        under this Agreement, and (b) transfer to UNICEF all intellectual and
        other propriety rights to the Programme Materials, including in the case
        of early termination, any data collected and work-in progress, and (c)

      <p>
        13.6 If UNICEF exercises its right to terminate this Agreement, UNICEF
        will have the right to require the Partner to repay to UNICEF such amount
        of money, up to the total amount paid to the Partner by UNICEF prior to
        the date of the notice of termination, as UNICEF will determine. It is
        understood that expenditures incurred by the Partner in compliance with
        this Agreement prior to the date of the notice of termination will not be
        required to be repaid. The payment owing by the Partner will be made

        13.7 If UNICEF exercises its right to terminate this Agreement and decides
        that the Programme is to be implemented by another organization or
        programming modality, the Partner will promptly provide full cooperation
        to UNICEF in the orderly transfer of all unused supplies and equipment
        provided to the Partner by UNICEF and the provisions of Article 13.5 above
        will apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.8 The suspension or termination of a Programme Document in accordance
        with this Section 13 will be without prejudice to the Programme
        Cooperation Agreement and other Programme Documents under this Agreement
        which will continue in effect, unless the Programme Cooperation Agreement
        and other Programme Documents are explicitly suspended or terminated
        together with a Programme Document. The suspension or termination of the
        Programme Cooperation Agreement will automatically suspend or terminate
        all Programme Documents issued thereunder, unless otherwise stated in the
        suspension or termination notice.
